This project aims to develop a hotel booking system using a graphical user interface (GUI) in Python with Tkinter. The system allows for managing bookings, viewing available rooms, adding and updating customer data, and providing a seamless and efficient user experience. The system is designed to be user-friendly with a simple interface and integrated functions to enhance the efficiency of daily hotel operations.
